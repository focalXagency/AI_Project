AI algorithms have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in interpreting medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. They can identify anomalies and deviations that might be overlooked by the human eye. This is particularly valuable in early disease detection. For instance, AI can aid radiologists in detecting minute irregularities in mammograms or identifying critical findings in chest X-rays, potentially indicative of life-threatening conditions.',
